# Raspberry Pi flask GPIO server

A flask server for controlling Raspberry Pi GPIO pins using a button interface.

When searching for how to control Raspberry Pi GPIO pins using the [Flask framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) it seems that all roads lead to [Matt Richardson's tutorial](http://mattrichardson.com/Raspberry-Pi-Flask/). This is a great starting point but I wanted to make it look nicer and use actual on-screen buttons to control the GPIO pins. 

This repository is my attempt to make some skeleton frameworks for using on screen buttons to control GPIO pins.
